# Section 1.5: Some Simple Programming Concepts

> One of the basic things you'll use in your programs is variables. Variables are just containers for other things, like numbers or letters. Before we start our first real program, let's practice using variables.

To use lua outside of a program, you need to use the `lua` program. Type that into your computer and press enter.

Now you can run the same commands you'd use in a program.
Let's try running `x = 5`. Type that and press enter.

#SCREENSHOT HERE

What you just did is store the number `5` inside a variable called `x`.
Now try running `print(x)`. This command prints out something. In this case it will print whatever is inside the variable `x`.

You can store anything you want inside a variable.
Try running `dog = "cat"`. Now if you run `print(dog)`, it will print out `cat`.

>You'll notice that when we typed `"cat"` there are quotes around the word cat. That's because if we just typed `cat`, it would treat it like a variable. We want to make `cat` a word (usually called a string) instead, so we put quotes around it, to make it `"cat"`.

And that's a quick explanation of variables! You can use them in much more complicated ways, but always remember that they're basically just containers for other stuff.
